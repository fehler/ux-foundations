UX Foundations
==============

<!-- **Book Proposal: Smashing Media AG** -->

The book provides a holistic overview of, and a beginners to intermediate introduction to User Experience (UX) design. It’s the ‘missing manual’ I’ve been looking for at Belfast School of Art.

I’m sure others might find it useful, too. We could perhaps serialise the book for Smashing Magazine’s membership, so that we get the maximum benefit from the content. (I could take care of the serialisation.) This could also be a nice way to give Adobe another hit of marketing for their support, if we gave them an acknowledgement?

I’d redraw all the diagrams and develop them. The approach would be like my first Standardistas’ book, with a section after each chapter of suggested reading, possibly downloadable templates, printables, etc..

Book Structure
--------------

I think it would be helpful to build the book around a typical UX process:

<!-- Get a diagram into the proposal here to clarify this model for the book structure. -->

+ Research
+ Design
+ Prototype
+ Build
+ Test

This feels like a logical structure (and I can’t recall seeing it done before). It echoes some of what I’ve begun to explore in the original series of articles for Adobe XD. I’ll develop a full table of contents shortly (what’s included here, is just me thinking aloud). Each section (below) has an indicative outline structure, also.

Table of Contents (Rough, Incomplete Draft)
-----------------

+ Foreword

+ Introduction

+ Chapter 1: Research
  + Research Methods

  + Macro-Prototyping: Adobe XD, InVision, etc.
  + Micro-Prototyping: Keynote, etc.

+ Chapter 4: Build
  + HTML, CSS, JS <!-- Be careful this doesn’t get too lost in detail. Remember this is a beginning to intermediate book, not an ‘everything you need to know about HTML, CSS and JS’ book. -->

+ Chapter 5: Test
  + Usability Testing
  + A Customisable Preamble and Testing Script <!-- Include a preamble and script in the downloadables. -->
  + Guidelines

+ Conclusion

+ Required Reading

+ Acknowledgements

+ Colophon

Foreword
--------

Why this book? Why me? <!-- This isn’t really foreword material, it’s more introduction material. Think about who could write a foreword. A little like A Book Apart’s books, the foreword helps give it a seal of approval. -->

Almost a decade ago I co-authored a book on [Web Standards Design](https://amzn.to/2HgsYt3) with my Standardistas partner-in-crime, Nicklas Persson. It was the missing textbook we needed for my teaching at Belfast School of Art. Things have moved on – as they inevitably do in our industry – and, once again, I’m looking for a textbook. This time one that introduces the fundamentals of User Experience (UX) design, from research right through to design, build and test.

<!-- #fuckferris… It’s not I and my team… it’s me. This book is what I, and my team, have built our teaching around at Belfast School of Art. -->

Introduction
------------

Why UX? Why now?

This is an expansion of article number one and the later articles on UX strategy. It’s designed to set the scene and 

It’s about competitive advantage, why design-driven companies deliver higher profits, etc. The rise of the Chief Design Officer (CDO).

Perhaps references some of Adobe’s statistics that explain why design is being embraced by industry and why user experience, in particular, is driving and disrupting industry.

Chapter 1: Research
-------------------

Above all, this first section is about aligning everything you do with users’ needs. It’s about the ‘U’ in UX. This section is critical…

In this section I’ll outline a number of different user research methods, tools that readers can use to inform their design. We might also include links to downloadable worksheets so that the book feels rounded.

It would be nice to have worksheets – branded with Smashing’s cat – similar to the ones I’ve been doing for Tiny Books:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/v16c8urdh5satho/ux-worksheets-like-this.pdf?dl=0

+ Define the problem.
+ Research Methods (A list of methods, with explanations, like a pick’n’mix.)
  + Card Sorting
  + Interviews
  + Etc.
+ Analysing Research Findings
+ User Stories /* Move this to the next section? Talk about taking your findings and creating user stories? Also, there’s a good worksheet here: User Stories. */


- - -


Chapter 2: Design
-----------------

This could kick off with the user stories as a bridge between research and design.

+ Universal Principles
  + Visual Grammar
  + Language and Typography
  + Narrative Design
+ Information Architecture
+ User Interface
+ Screens ≠ Print


- - -


Chapter 3: Prototype
--------------------

I think we should widen the scope here, beyond the restriction to Adobe XD that the Adobe sponsored articles imposed, i.e. include more than just Adobe XD, also include, e.g. InVision, Keynote, etc..

+ Lo-fi Prototypes
+ Wireframes // A lot more here. This article can be expanded considerably. //
+ UI, UI Kits
+ Animation


- - -


Chapter 4: Build
----------------

This chapter feels a little out of place for a high level book… Are we talking about high fidelity prototypes here? In this context, perhaps? Although I could also touch on a cross-section of tools designers can use to build immersive prototypes. (Except that’s covered in the chapter before….) 

Be careful this doesn’t get too lost in detail. Remember this is a beginning to intermediate book, not an ‘everything you need to know about HTML, CSS and JS’ book.

Chapter 5: Test
---------------

Again, this draws on the Smashing + Adobe articles (No. 8).
