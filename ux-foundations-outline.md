UX Foundations
==============

**Initial Outline: Monday, 16 April, 2017**

This book is intended as a beginners to intermediate introduction to User Experience (UX) design. It’s the ‘missing manual’ I’ve been looking for at Belfast School of Art.

I recommend lots of books on my Interaction Design programme, each focused on a different aspect of UX, what I really need, however, is a book that provides a holistic overview of UX.

In addition to students new to UX this book could also serve as the basis for graphic designers – and others – wishing to transition into UX design.

We could perhaps serialise the book for Smashing Magazine’s membership, so that we get the maximum benefit from the content. (I could take care of the serialisation, breaking the content down.)

I’d redraw all the diagrams and develop them. We might approach the book like my first [Standardistas’](https://amzn.to/2HgsYt3) book, with a section after each chapter of suggested reading, possibly downloadable templates, printables, etc..

In addition to the core book we could explore additional worksheets – similar to those I designed for Tiny Books, [like this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v16c8urdh5satho/ux-worksheets-like-this.pdf?dl=0), but Smashing Magazine branded – so that there was a sense that this was **more than a book….**

Book Structure
--------------

I think it would be helpful to build the book around a typical UX process:

<!-- Get a diagram into the proposal here to clarify this model for the book structure. -->

+ Research
+ Design
+ Prototype
+ Build
+ Test

This feels like a logical structure (and I can’t recall seeing it done before). It echoes some of what I’ve begun to explore in the original series of articles for Adobe XD.

I’ll develop a full table of contents shortly; what’s included below, is just me thinking aloud.

Foreword
--------

Think about who could write a foreword. A foreword helps give the book a seal of approval and it's useful for spreading the word.

Introduction
------------

Why UX? Why now? Why me?

Almost a decade ago I co-authored a book on [Web Standards Design](https://amzn.to/2HgsYt3) with my Standardistas partner-in-crime, Nicklas Persson. It was the missing textbook we needed for my teaching at Belfast School of Art.

Things have moved on – as they inevitably do in our industry – and, once again, I’m looking for a textbook. This time one that introduces the fundamentals of User Experience (UX) design, from research right through to designing, building and testing.

The introduction should be an expansion of article one in my Adobe XD series. It’s designed to set the scene and stress the importance of UX design in the here and now.

It’s about competitive advantage, why design-driven companies deliver higher profits, the rise of the Chief Design Officer (CDO), etc..

The introduction should also highlight who the book is targeted at: anyone studying UX (stress that it's been thoroughly road-tested on my students at Belfast School of Art); anyone moving into UX.

/* Perhaps references some of Adobe’s statistics that explain why design is being embraced by industry and why user experience, in particular, is driving and disrupting industry. */

Chapter 1: Research
-------------------

Above all, this first section is about aligning everything you do with users’ needs. It’s about the ‘U’ in UX. This section is critical.

In this section I’ll outline a number of different user research methods, tools that readers can use to inform their design. We might also include links to downloadable worksheets so that the book feels rounded.

It would be nice to have worksheets – branded with Smashing’s cat – similar to the ones I’ve been doing for Tiny Books:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/v16c8urdh5satho/ux-worksheets-like-this.pdf?dl=0

+ Define the problem.
+ Research Methods (A list of methods, with explanations, like a pick’n’mix.)
  + Card Sorting
  + Interviews
  + Etc.
+ Analysing Research Findings
+ User Stories /* Move this to the next section? Talk about taking your findings and creating user stories? Also, there’s a good worksheet here: User Stories. */


- - -


Chapter 2: Design
-----------------

This could kick off with the user stories as a bridge between research and design.

+ Universal Principles
  + Visual Grammar
  + Language and Typography
  + Narrative Design
+ Information Architecture
+ User Interface
+ Screens ≠ Print


- - -


Chapter 3: Prototype
--------------------

I think we should widen the scope here, beyond the restriction to Adobe XD that the Adobe sponsored articles imposed, i.e. include more than just Adobe XD, also include, e.g. InVision, Keynote, etc..

+ Lo-fi Prototypes
+ Wireframes // A lot more here. This article can be expanded considerably. //
+ UI, UI Kits
+ Animation


- - -


Chapter 4: Build
----------------

This chapter feels a little out of place for a high level book… Are we talking about high fidelity prototypes here? In this context, perhaps? Although I could also touch on a cross-section of tools designers can use to build immersive prototypes. (Except that’s covered in the chapter before….) 

Be careful this doesn’t get too lost in detail. Remember this is a beginning to intermediate book, not an ‘everything you need to know about HTML, CSS and JS’ book.

Chapter 5: Test
---------------

Again, this draws on the Smashing + Adobe articles (No. 8).
